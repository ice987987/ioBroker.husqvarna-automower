## husqvarna-automower adapter for ioBroker

This adapter fetches data from your Husqvarna lawn mower from [https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/) via the "new" WebSocket connection and works with [Automower Connect API](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/apis/Automower+Connect+API) v1.0.0.

## Installation requirements

* node.js >= v14.0 is required
* js-controller >= v3.3.19 is required
* admin >= v5.1.28 is required
* This adapter uses the Husqvarna API-Key to request data (via WebSocket) for your Husqvarna lawn mower. You must sign up at [https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/) to get an API-Key.

**Please make sure that you have created an account, password and API-Key according to [these instructions](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/docs/getting-started). "Old" logins will not work.**

## Control

You can send the following values to your Husqvarna lawn mower:
* `.ACTIONS.PAUSE`: pause mower
* `.ACTIONS.PARKUNTILNEXTSCHEDULE`: park mower until next scheduled run
* `.ACTIONS.PARKUNTILFURTHERNOTICE`: park mower until further notice, overriding schedule
* `.ACTIONS.park.PARK`: park mower for a duration of time `.ACTIONS.park.parkTime` (in minutes), overriding schedule
* `.ACTIONS.RESUMESCHEDULE`: resume mower according to schedule
* `.ACTIONS.start.START`: start mower and cut for a duration of time `.ACTIONS.start.startTime` (in minutes), overriding schedule
* `.ACTIONS.CUTTINGHEIGHT`: Update cuttingHeight [^2][^3]
* `.ACTIONS.HEADLIGHT`: Update headlight
* `.ACTIONS.schedule.SET`: Update mower schedule with `.ACTIONS.schedule.[0-3].start` (minutes after midnight), `.ACTIONS.schedule.[0-3].duration` (in minutes), `.ACTIONS.schedule.[0-3].monday`, `.ACTIONS.schedule.[0-3].tuesday`, `.ACTIONS.schedule.[0-3].wednesday`, `.ACTIONS.schedule.[0-3].thursday`, `.ACTIONS.schedule.[0-3].friday`, `.ACTIONS.schedule.[0-3].saturday` and `.ACTIONS.schedule.[0-3].sunday` [^2]
[^2]: Do not use for 550 EPOS and Ceora due to [Husqvarna's API-limitation](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/apis/Automower+Connect+API#/readme)
[^3]: not supported models: 405X, 415X and 435X AWD (you will get the error "This mower use missions and can not be updated by this endpoint")

## Available values (readonly)

You get the following values from your Husqvarna lawn mower:
* `.battery.batteryPercent`: Information about the battery in the mower
* `.calendar.[0-3].start`: Start time expressed in minutes after midnight
* `.calendar.[0-3].duration`: Duration time expressed in minutes
* `.calendar.[0-3].monday`: Enabled on Mondays
* `.calendar.[0-3].tuesday`: Enabled on Tuesdays
* `.calendar.[0-3].wednesday`: Enabled on Wednesdays
* `.calendar.[0-3].thurdsay`: Enabled on Thursdays
* `.calendar.[0-3].friday`: Enabled on Fridays
* `.calendar.[0-3].saturday`: Enabled on Saturdays
* `.calendar.[0-3].sunday`: Enabled on Sundays
* `.metadata.connected`: is the mower currently connected
* `.metadata.statusTimestamp`: is the mower currently connected, time in ms
* `.mower.activity`: Information about the mowers current activity
* `.mower.errorCode`: Information about the mowers current error status
* `.mower.errorTimestamp`: Timestamp for the last error code in milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00 in local time. NOTE! This timestamp is in local time for the mower and is coming directly from the mower
* `.mower.mode`: Information about the mowers current mode
* `.mower.state`: Information about the mowers current status
* `.planner.action`: TODO
* `.planner.nextStartTimestamp`: Timestamp for the next auto start in milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00 in local time. If the mower is charging then the value is the estimated time when it will be leaving the charging station. If the value is 0 then the mower should start now. NOTE! This timestamp is in local time for the mower and is coming directly from the mower
* `.planner.restrictedReason`: restrictedReason
* `.positions.latitude`: Position latitude
* `.positions.longitude`: Position longitude
* `.positions.latlong`: Position "latitude;longitude"
* `.settings.cuttingHeight`: Prescaled cutting height, Range: 1...9
* `.settings.headlight`: Headlight status
* `.system.id`: Device ID
* `.system.model`: Device model
* `.system.name`: Device name
* `.system.serialNumber`: Device serialnumber
* `.system.type`: Device type

## Limitation

* maximum 4 schedules are available[^1]
[^1]: If more schedules are needed, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ice987987/ioBroker.husqvarna-automower/issues/new/choose).

## ioBroker.vis bindings
the following code can be used for html-bindings in adapter [ioBroker.vis](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.vis#bindings-of-objects) to translate the [status description and error codes](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/apis/Automower+Connect+API#/status%20description%20and%20error%20codes) into text for better visualization:

## How to report issues and feature requests

Please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ice987987/ioBroker.husqvarna-automower/issues/new/choose) and fill in the form.

For issues:
Set the adapter to debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Get the logfile from disk (subdirectory "log" in ioBroker installation directory and not from Admin because Admin cuts the lines). Check that there are no personal information before you publish your log.
