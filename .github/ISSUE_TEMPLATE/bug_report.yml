        If this is the first time you are doing this, please take a few moments to read
        through the [README](https://github.com/ice987987/ioBroker.husqvarna-automower/blob/main/README.md).

        You are about to report a bug in **husqvarna-automower Adapter**. Do not proceed if your issues
        occurs with ioBroker itself, any third party adapters, unofficial or outdated
        adapter versions.

        And finally, make sure any bug you want to report is still present with the **current**
        adapter (beta) version.

        Thank you for your collaboration!
